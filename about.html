        Hailing from Bergen, Astroturf is a rising pop-rock sensation featuring five young but accomplished musicians hailing from different parts of Norway. Known for their high-energy rock music with soaring choruses, earworm melodies, and guitar solos that harken back to the 80s, this band offers a rock experience that's both authentic and unforgettable.
The band's story began with Susanne and Alvin, who fell in love and started writing songs together. Before long, they decided to form a band, which came to fruition in February 2022. Since then, they've recorded four singles and released one, while also performing at four concerts. Moreover, they have an upcoming gig every month this spring.
But Astroturf is more than just a band. They're also committed to sustainability, as evidenced by their innovative merch project. Instead of buying new shirts, they asked friends and acquaintances to donate old ones that were then sent for printing. Their ultimate goal is to showcase these eco-friendly tees at the Europavox campus, with all shirts sourced from second-hand stores or friends.

          Get ready to rock out with Astroturf, the hottest pop-rock sensation to hit Bergen! With five talented and fresh-faced musicians hailing from all corners of Norway, this band is all about high-energy, catchy tunes with big choruses, shredding guitar solos, and a touch of 80s nostalgia. They're the real deal, no frills, no gimmicks - just pure rock 'n' roll!
The story of Astroturf begins with a steamy romance between Susanne and Alvin, who couldn't resist the urge to write songs together. Before long, they decided to take things to the next level and form a band - and the rest is history! Since their debut in February 2022, they've recorded four kick-ass singles and rocked out at four concerts. And that's just the beginning, honey - they've got a gig lined up for every month this spring!
But wait, there's more! Astroturf isn't just about making music - they're also eco-friendly and socially conscious. Their merch project is a game-changer - instead of buying new shirts, they've teamed up with their friends and acquaintances to donate old tees, which they've then printed with their logo. And the pièce de résistance? They're bringing their sustainable swag to the Europavox campus, where all their shirts will be sourced from second-hand stores or donated by friends. Now that's what we call a rock star move!
